"""Time to recover (TTR) per machine: model-free incident records and their report.

An incident starts when a machine this project watches goes down and ends when nothing says so any
more. A project watches the machines its charter's Resources name, those it is the recovery owner or
fallback of, and those its own heal checks name. A machine is down while any of these says so:
- one of this project's heal checks reports it to the machine ledger (`machine_reported`: down or
  held, past the check's own rules for unknown results, findings and known faults; heal.py), from
  the check's first unhealthy run (`since`);
- a co-tenant's condition on it in the shared routes file (machine_ledger.report) seen within
  machine_ledger.CONDITION_GONE_S, from its `first` report;
- a known outage recorded for it (`ttp machines outage`), from when it was recorded.
The earliest of these is the incident's start, and its kind (down, held or outage) and cause. Its end
is the first daemon tick (every OBSERVE_S) that finds none of them; a later tick that finds one again
starts a new incident, never before the last one ended. When the open incident's source recovers but
another of a different kind and cause (say a known outage after a heal check) keeps the machine down,
the incident hands over: it ends when the new source began (no earlier than it started) and a new one
opens from there with the new kind and cause, so each source's incident keeps its own start and
cause. A source changing only its kind (a heal check's down to held) or only its cause keeps it.

Records live in this project's database (ttr_incidents): rows are only added, and each row's end is
written once. A unique index allows one open incident per machine and every step is one transaction,
so a daemon restart or host reboot mid-incident neither loses nor duplicates one: the next tick finds
the open row and keeps it, or ends it once the machine is healthy. While the daemon is stopped nothing
is observed: a recovery in that time is recorded at its first tick after. While the project is paused
heal checks do not run, so their reports freeze: a heal report whose last check is older than the
check's period plus HEAL_STALE_MARGIN_S is ignored then, and an incident only it kept open ends at that
tick, at the latest its last unhealthy sample plus the check's period (below);
co-tenant conditions and known outages still count.

A heal check samples only every period, so a short fault would last until the next healthy sample: while a
heal check keeps an incident open, its row records the check's last unhealthy sample (`last_bad`, the
check's last run) and period (`period_s`), and the incident ends no later than that sample plus the
period (no earlier than it started), even when the recovering sample or the tick that sees it is later.
Another source keeping it open clears both, and rows from before they were recorded keep their end.

`ttp ttr [<project>] [<alias>] [--days N] [--json]` reports per machine the incidents in the window
(those still open, or that ended within it), the median, p90 and max TTR of the ended ones, the open
ones and the last one; the daily review carries one line per machine with an incident in REVIEW_DAYS.
An incident that starts inside the window of a test change (`ttp machines change add --test`) by the same
project on the same machine (from the entry's `added` until it was closed, or now while it is open) is a
test: it is labelled at report time, so rows recorded before are too, has kind 'test', stays out of the
counts and median, p90 and max, and is listed apart (count, then up to TEST_LISTED of them). Another
project's entry or another machine's never relabels one. Closed entries are kept
machine_ledger.CLOSED_KEPT_S, as long as the `ttp ttr` default window.
