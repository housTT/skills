"""Run-start checks of what a reboot or a cleanup can take away, before a task's workspace is made:

- the task's worktree, when its `.git` file names a git dir that is gone (dangling). When the
  repository it belonged to is gone too (a clone left empty or removed), the commits it never
  pushed went with it: its files move aside and the task is blocked (worktree.WorkspaceStuck), never
  continued on a fresh worktree as if nothing happened. So is one whose repository is there but no
  longer has the task's recorded branch (cloned again). When only git's record of it is gone, its
  commits are kept in the repository: its files move aside and the worktree is made again.
- the clone code worktrees are made from (the project root): one that was a git repository and
  now has no .git directory blocks the task; one on a file system a reboot empties (tmpfs, ramfs)
  is reported, as is a worktrees folder there.
- ~/.ssh/known_hosts, missing or empty while this project uses ssh (machines are listed, or the
  file was seen before): ssh to verified hosts then fails host key checks.

Each finding is a model-free observation for the coordinator (one per condition a day), a line in
the worker's prompt, the run's note (`start_checks`) and the task's stored hand-off. Reads files
only, apart from moving a dangling worktree aside."""
