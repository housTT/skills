"""Interim mitigation: a known defect that degrades a live service gets a workaround with a due time,
not only a fix.

A fix goes through review, push and deploy, which can take days; the live service stays degraded all
that time. So a hand-off that states live impact in its structured field `live_impact` (top level, or
on one of its `followups`) makes the daemon queue, model-free, a priority-1 mitigation task beside the
fix (file()). The field is `"<resource> <what is degraded>"` or `{"resource": ..., "what": ...}` (a list
of either at top level). Free text is never parsed for it. The fix is the reporting code task itself
(a top-level `live_impact`), the follow-up that carries it, or none yet: then the QUEUED event stays
queued for the coordinator, which queues one.

The mitigation's spec names the resource, the defect and the fix, and asks for the least-disruptive
safe workaround the charter or memory already approves (a restart, a manual escalation, rerouting work,
a heal check). It is due coordinator.mitigation_due_h hours after it was filed (DUE_H; 0 turns filing
off). One open mitigation per resource: a later report for the same resource adds none.

tend(), every tick: an open mitigation past its due time (not done or cancelled) raises one high
OVERDUE event, which wakes the coordinator at high effort; none once its fix task is done (the fix,
not the workaround, ends the impact). Once the fix task is done too, the mitigation's
temporary measures (its hand-off's `temporary_measures` [{what, undo}], and the open change-ledger
entries it recorded) are listed for undo in one UNDO event. The blocker sweep (sweep.items) and
`ttp status` list every open mitigation with its due time.
