"""One wording for every user-facing message about a resource outage (a machine down or held, a device
held with no tenant, a heal check's outage): when it started (home zone, with its abbreviation), how long
it has lasted so far, who is acting now (the owner, the fallback and why the owner was passed over, or
"nobody: escalating"), the tracked task and its due time when there is one, what was tried, and the next
step. `facts` builds that part; machine pages (machine_ledger.route), the daemon's outage alerts, heal
checks' outage and hold alerts all append it to their own first sentence.

A message that only says "nothing was changed" or "a note was sent" leaves the reader guessing who has
it. `bare` names such a text (an outage message with that phrasing and no actor): the daemon's alerts
add the actor to it (`ensure_actor`), and a coordinator notify saying it is refused with what to say.

A tracked task and due time are read from the page or condition when a caller recorded them (`task`,
`due`); absent, the line says there is none.
